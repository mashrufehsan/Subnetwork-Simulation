# Subnetwork Simulation using Cisco Packet Tracer
Subnet simulation using Cisco Packet Tracer for CSE438L - Data Communication &amp; Network Lab project.

Here, I built a subnetwork using Cisco Packet Tracer for my CSE438 DATA COMMUNICATION & NETWORK Lab project.

**The project requirements were:**
- Figure out the Subnet Mask and Network ID from the given IP address. [192.183.49.0/22]
- You will have to design a system for a company named "Johnson & Johnson". The company has 5 departments-
Production, Research & Development, Finance, Sales & Marketing, Human Resources.
- Create a Sub-Network for each of the department, five in total. 
- Each Sub-Network should be reachable from all others.
- You will use Switch and Hub.
- Use serial connections to connect the routers to each other. You can use any Network IP of your choice for connecting two routers.
- Connect at least 3 PCs in each sub-network.
- There will be a single DHCP server in the Human Resources sub-network and all the PCs in all 5 sub-networks will be assigned IP addresses by using this DHCP server.
- Research & Development and Sales & Marketing network should have DNS and HTTP service. 
- You will have to use any routing protocols among RIP, OSPF, EIGRP. [*Bonus marks will be given if you can use all three routing protocols in your system.*]
